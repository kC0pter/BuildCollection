# Full DPS Striker with Oreo

Tags: PVE, Countdown, Incursion, Heroic, SMG, DPS, Weapon, Gearset, Shield  
Version: TU19

## Description

* Suited for Countdown
  * Also works for Incursion -- change 1-2 Mods to Crit Chance (depending on how many Coyotes Masks the others are running)
* Only has 47% Crit Chance because usually multiple Coyotes buffs active in Countdown -> pushes to 57+%
* Runs Rock'n'Roll as secondary for stacking, though Ouroboros can build stacks quick as well
* Playstyle: Stack striker stacks up, do headshots, don't get hit
